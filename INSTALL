To install Mickey Scheme, you need a C++ compiler, dlopen et al. and
readline.  If you don't have readline, remove -DUSE_READLINE from
src/Makefile.

If you have both and reside on OS X, just type

    $ make -j run

to fire up a REPL.  On Linux, you have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be able to
locate dynamic shared objects in your current directory:

    $ CXX=c++ make -ej
    ...
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:" ./mickey

That's all there is to it!
